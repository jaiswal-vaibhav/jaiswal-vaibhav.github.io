                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Dr. Vaibhav Jaiswal is a research engineer at the French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN), France. In this capacity, he leverages his expertise in the development of nuclear cross section data and Monte Carlo codes, with a specific focus on thermal scattering cross section data for moderator materials. His expansive knowledge of nuclear data is instrumental in his work on Monte Carlo code development at IRSN, marking a significant contribution to the institute's research capabilities.</p>
                    <p>Beginning his academic pursuit at the University of Delhi, India, Dr. Jaiswal achieved a bachelor's degree in Physics. This foundation led him to attain an M. Tech degree in Nuclear Science and Technology at the same university. With a desire to broaden his understanding and deepen his exposure to nuclear sciences, he relocated to France. Here, he earned a specialized master’s degree in Nuclear Engineering from the National Institute for Nuclear Science and Technology (INSTN), subsequently securing a PhD from the University of Lille. His research focus on thermal scattering cross section data development has set a robust foundation for his ongoing research endeavors.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Jaiswal's professional journey is highlighted by numerous time-of-flight experiments and atomistic simulations, which have proven crucial in generating thermal scattering cross section data. His meticulous and focused approach has resulted in significant contributions in the nuclear science domain.</p>
                    <p>Supplementing his experimental and simulation work, Dr. Jaiswal is an active participant in the Joint Evaluated Fission and Fusion (JEFF) community. His involvement with JEFF showcases his commitment to scientific collaboration, indicating his consistent contributions to the wider nuclear science community.</p>
